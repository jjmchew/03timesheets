# Timesheets project

- I've been tracking time spent for a variety of different projects in a variety of different ways (google spreadsheets, another timer app I created, a .csv file). Each method has various pros and cons.  I've put together a few different things into the latest little project to hopefully do it all in a more convenient way.
- Sadly, at the end of the day, it still comes down to me - I need to take the initiative to track the time I spend.
- Ruby / Sinatra / PostgreSQL
